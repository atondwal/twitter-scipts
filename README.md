Twitter Scripts
===============
These are some scripts I wrote in order to tweet stuff on either of my clipboard buffers or my gtalk status.

## Files

I recommend setting all the shell scripts to hotkeys.

### gtalk.py

This tweets its first argument. I didn't make it use stdin, because I was expecting to use it by hand.

### gtalk.js

This is a node.js script to fetch my gtalk status.

### gtalk.sh

This tweets my gtalk status.

### xclip.sh

This tweets what's in my Xorg CLIPBOARD buffer.

### xclips.sh

This tweets what's in my Xorg PRIMARY buffer.
